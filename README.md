# THE_LAST_SHOT_Game_Unity


> **"What if taking a photo was more dangerous than pulling a trigger?"**

I am pleased to announce that my team and I have successfully completed our horror game as part of the **Game Design and Implementation** course at **FCIS**. 🤩🔥🔥

**THE LAST SHOT** is a first-person survival horror photography game built with **Unity**. You play as a professional photojournalist working for the secretive **SpectraVision Agency**. Your mission is simple but deadly: document rare, dangerous creatures that the world refuses to believe exist.

No weapons. No backup. Only your camera… and whatever is watching you in the dark.

## 🎮 Game Concept & Story

What begins as a documentation task quickly descends into a psychological struggle for survival as you uncover the truth behind SpectraVision’s sinister genetic experiments.

### 🧠 They learn from you:

* 
**👂 Dynamic AI**: Creatures react to sound, movement, and light, forcing you to use strategic stealth.


* 
**💡 Adaptive Behavior**: Monsters follow your light sources and can be distracted by noise tools.


* 
**📷 High-Risk Photography**: Every photo is an achievement and a risk—closer, clearer shots earn higher rewards but put you in immediate danger.

## 🔥 Key Features

* 
**Non-Violent Survival**: Survival depends on observation, timing, and precision rather than combat.


* 
**Realistic Photography Mechanics**: Advanced camera system with adjustable zoom, focus, exposure, and flash.


* 
**Dynamic Resource Management**: Manage camera storage, torch batteries, health (blood level), and a strictly limited mission timer.


* 
**Atmospheric Environments**: Explore fog-filled jungles, decaying cities, and volcanic caverns.


* 
**Upgradeable Gear**: Use earned currency in the Game Shop to upgrade cameras, torches, protective suits, and more.

## 🛠 Gameplay Mechanics

### Photography Scoring

Your photos are graded in real-time based on several factors:

* 
**Distance**: Closer shots earn higher quality scores.


* 
**Clarity**: Focused subjects provide bonus XP.


* 
**Rarity**: Unique and rare creatures provide massive rewards.



### Difficulty Progression

The game features 5 levels ranging from **Very Easy** to **Very Hard**. As you progress:

* 
**Decreasing Time**: Mission duration drops (20 – 18 – 16 – 14 – 12 minutes) to increase tension.


* 
**Stronger Monsters**: Enemies become faster and more aggressive.


* 
**Rare Encounters**: Higher levels increase the chance of finding unique monsters (up to a 1% rare spawn rate).

## 💭 The Core Question:

**How far would you go to capture the truth knowing it might destroy you?** 

At the end of your journey, the choice is yours:

1. 
**Tell the Truth**: Expose the Agency to the media and reveal their experiments.


2. 
**Keep Silent**: Bury the secret… and pay the price for your silence.
